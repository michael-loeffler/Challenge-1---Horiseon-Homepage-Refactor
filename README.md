# Challenge 1: Horiseon Homepage Refactor

## Description

A Refactoring of Horiseon's Homepage to adhere to accessibility standards and improve search engine optimization.

I was motivated to refactor this webpage because it did not meet accessibility standards, let alone baseline HTML/CSS standards. The starter code for this webpage did not include semantic HTML elements, a title, and even had a broken hyperlink. Additionally, the CSS rules contained many redundancies that needed to be consolidated. The main issue here was that the code lacked descriptive elements. The code was difficult for other developers to decipher, and was not written in a way to make the published webpage accessible to people using assistive technologies. Therefore, I refactored this webpage in order to allow the widest array of people access to the content within the site. Utilizing universal design practices* is so important when constructing webpages and web applications because by considering the needs of every potential user from the start, you ensure a product that can be used by anyone. This refactor then allows people of all abilities to access the site by providing descriptive alt text for all images, and using semantic HTML elements to give the flow of the page good organizational structure. The semantic HTML elements also improve search engine optimization by allowing the critical content on the page to be more easily searchable, bringing more traffic to the client's webpage. 

Through working on this project, I learned how to create a well organized HTML page with descriptive/specific semantic HTML tags, classes and id's. Additionally, I learned how to use anchor tags to hyperlink to specific sections on the same page, as well as to add alt attributes to image tags. Finally, I learned how to work smarter, not harder, by strategically and efficiently utilizing CSS selectors to apply rules to more than one HTML element, while only needing to write the rules once. 

**"Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits."*
